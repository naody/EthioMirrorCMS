<p>Wussane is a tear jerker like no other, but Maserasha Mamo thinks it may not be worthy of your money.</p>
<p>In Wussane (Decision), Indian-Ethiopian movie maker, Tom Thomson, forges a storyline familiar in Indian cinema � heart-wrenching human suffering and anguish paired with an unlikely happy ending.</p>
<p>Genet Negatu delivers an outstanding performance as Hiwot, a caring teacher who learns that she is dying of cancer. The narrative follows Hiwot from her difficult childhood in a church-run orphanage to her troubled marriage to an irresponsible alcoholic. When her husband is murdered, she takes upon herself the task of finding adoptive families for her four children, one of whom is handicapped, in a race against time.</p>
<p>The movie is filled with touching and sometimes unrealistically depressing twists and turns, with scenarios so elaborate that one detects a terrifying, almost sadistic motive in its director. Hiwot dies without finding adoptive parents for her handicapped child, and her relatives abandon him at a church, motherless and homeless. The audience is hurled from one scene to another in a whirlwind of grief, without time for solemn contemplation.</p>
<p>Therein lies the ingenuity of the director. Wussane taps into the Ethiopian psyche which recognizes divine logic in suffering and misery, and grapples with transcendental explanations for anguish and defeat. Like the onscreen drama, agony and torment fit together like an ugly puzzle; life is liberated by pain. The happy ending is so shockingly detached from the somber thrust of the movie that it appears almost as an after-thought.</p>
<p>This makes Wussane the most popular film in Addis Ababa today, explains one critic, simply �because it is so sad�. Already in its fifth month, theatre line-ups throughout the city form hours in advance and tissue sellers continue to make record profits from movie-going buyers well aware of the film�s status as �wantonly tear-jerking�. Some see the movie again and again, merely to weep again and again.</p>
<p>However, despite popularity, Wussane clearly lacks cinematic magic. Part of the storyline is borrowed without acknowledgement from an old American TV film, Who Will Love My Children. In the American version, Ann Maragreth portrays a rural Iowan mother dying of cancer with an alcoholic husband who, like Wussane�s Hiwot, is forced to find foster parents for her children before her death.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the scenes in Wussane are directly lifted out of the same film, and conspicuously betray the director�s failure to contextualize them. The scenes depicting the children riding bicycles collides with the impossibly rugged terrain of the country�s capital, Addis Ababa, in which the story takes place. Self-evident Ethiopian cultural norms are also sacrificed for the plot--leaving a handicapped child in church on the same day as his mother�s burial is highly improbable.</p>
<p>Poor portraits abound. Hiwot dies serenely, with no visible change in her body despite her battle with cancer. The soundtrack is also at odds with the story. Although the melancholy melodies suggest tragedy, they aren�t well-matched with the scenes; the soundtrack switches from Indian to Ethiopian music without reason and the volume varies arbitrarily. The make-up, however, is good by Ethiopian film standards.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Wussane is long on emotion, but short on logic and realism. Watching it, one can�t help feeling duped--duped by the movie-maker�s awareness of our urge for pure masochism.</p>
