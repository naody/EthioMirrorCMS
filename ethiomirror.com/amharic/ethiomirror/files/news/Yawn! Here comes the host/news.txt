<p>ETV�s talk shows are talk, yammer and bore. They need to put the meat on the bone to be taken seriously. Less talk helps, says Mesfin Negash.</p>
<p>In a country where communication with metaphors and allusions are celebrated, Solomon Shumiye thinks that the straight talk express of TV talk shows can ride out the jam. Seated in his small one-room studio, he is revising the edited version of the copy of the recorded program he has to submit to Ethiopian Television (ETV) for broadcast. The program needs approval before it goes on air. With ETV rules requiring submission of the tapes 72 hours before the show, Solomon has only a day to complete the revision - chop and change.</p>
<p>ETV, the country�s only TV station, runs five talk shows, all produced by independent media organizations. Two of those programs--Ethiopian Idol and Debo--are music shows. Solomon�s Shay Buna tackles meaty issues like development and poverty without delving into the controversial arena of Ethiopian politics. Fegegta and Hamsa Lomi follow the same format, but with different substance. No external competitors to these issue-based TV talk shows means Solomon and other producers don�t have to work that hard to stand out.</p>
<p>Henok Abebe, a development worker, is a regular follower of the Shay Buna program. Solomon, he thinks, is assured, but lacks the quality to present challenging issues in a �relaxing� and �sardonic� way. �Too boring for Sunday morning,� he says. The latest show on the celebration of the millennium was certainly unpromising. There were too many issues and too much unfocused analytics.</p>
<p>Solomon calls his show �developmental� which tries to address the problems of our existence; not in the philosophical sense, but in the practical bread and butter sense. That limits his ability to go �tabloid� where warmth and intimacy dominate the format. Yet a communications lecturer at Addis Ababa University, who requested anonymity, argues that agility, easy body language, sensuality and inventiveness on the host�s part could have made the show less boring.</p>
<p>�Without compromising the standard of discourse, he can be witty, cheerful, unpredictable and, sometimes, even slightly teasing to make it watchable,� says the lecturer.</p>
<p>Unlike Shay Buna, Fegegta is a single issue talk show. The aim is to encourage discourse about HIV/AIDS, but in a way that is less pessimistic; a light take on the single most important health issue in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>�The philosophy is great, but the presentation less so,� states the AAU lecturer. �They want to be our family members, be with us during our meals and converse about AIDS. I don�t think they got the balance right.�</p>
<p>Getting the balance right needs grasping what appears to be a paradox. Is it possible to tell people that AIDS is dangerous without repeating the caricature we are used to? Can we learn from the stories of others without feeling the anguish they have been through? Can we smile on and about AIDS? A lot of viewers say they couldn�t detect this show�s difference from other programs on AIDS except that a lot of people talk on it.</p>
<p>Hamsa Lomi, produced and hosted by Mahider Bekele and Degearege Nekatibeb�both former radio journalists--focus on �soft social issues�. The format is more on the �Tabloid� side, but with slightly uplifted use of language. It is a guest/celebrity plus presenter type, and unlike both Shay Buna and Fegegeta, there is a very limited participatory role for studio audience. This restriction has made the show look more organized and controlled than the two shows which usually end up in disarray.</p>
<p>�I think theirs is a better talk show, because they know their limitation. But sometimes they try to hard to impress, using pompous language, and showering praise after praise on their guests. Their format calls for a more informal method of communication,� says the AAU lecturer.</p>
<p>Solomon does all the talk show almost by himself. He selects and researches the topics, identifies and invites speakers, hosts and facilitates the show, and edits and submits the tapes for transmission. His only supporting staff, comprising two employees, does the secretarial work and the liasoning.</p>
<p>The effects of this bundling of tasks are clear. Sometimes, the host appears unaware of the issues in his topics, but presents his views with cheeky confidence. In other times, his show is devoid of people who can talk authoritatively on the subject of discussion. And in all of the time, the quality of editing looks poor. Solomon, however, insists that he is capable of doing all the work, and sometimes he is helped by a group of voluntary professionals.</p>
<p>Daniel Zewdu works as a consultant in media relations for a number of international organizations in Addis Ababa. He argues that Solomon�s problem is common to all of the shows.</p>
<p>�They lack both the internal capacity and external environment to address the issues they are claiming to entertain,� he says.</p>
<p>Fegegeta�s staff size is larger, but most of them work in financial and administrative units. As to the Hamsa Lomi, the producers have outsourced the film production to an independent company, but still do all other tasks.</p>
<p>A lot of viewers also complain about the shows� tendency to deal with a single topic for more than a week. Zeleke Belay, Deputy Producer of Fegegta, says that only 26 topics were presented in 72 weeks. Henoke finds that an antithesis to the cultural changes the purport to bring.</p>
<p>�This culture is typical Ethiopian. It has laziness written all of it. If you are the editor of the show, you should take out the best, show it and move on. This isn�t a soap opera,� he says.</p>
<p>Stage setting is a critical component of talk shows. Except Hamsa Lomi, which has a better stage management, the other shows appear rather like panel discussion mainly because of stage setting problems.</p>
<p>�Proper arrangement of available space is the expression of our respect for the profession and the viewers. Our show hosts need to take that seriously,� Daniel argues.</p>
<p>Back in Solomon�s studio, he finishes his review and prepares more copy of the tape. There is a satisfactory look on his face. �My program is very popular, and it is bringing real change in the community,� he says with a grin. Zeleke is equally self-congratulatory.</p>
<p>Daniel is not impressed. He scoffs at the tendency to identify and exaggerate the media�s direct effect on social change without rigorous academic research. And he has this message for our talk show hosts.</p>
<p>�In a limited media environment, taking the plaudits of viewers who has no alternative is as a sign of competence if wrong. Objectively speaking, the talk shows on ETV are lacking in professional standard; confused and confusing; and more of fashion than passion or necessity. They need a dose of hard work, and less of talk.�</p>
<p>It is an irony that less talk is the recipe for the success of talk shows.</p>
