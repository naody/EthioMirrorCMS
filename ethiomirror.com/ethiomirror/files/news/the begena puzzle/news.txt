<p>Words flow from Alemu Aga's lips like a fresh spring from the highlands. They are captivating but his demeanor is calm, like the begena he plays with exquisite mastery. In front of his souvenir shop in Piazza, flocks of sheep cross the street, people hustle and bustle, cars honk irrationally, and beggars stalk pedestrians, cars and all other moving objects. The outside is antithetical to the serene atmosphere inside the shop mirroring the unique melancholy sounds of the begena in the frantic world of Ethiopian music.</p>
<p>Alemu Aga's name is synonymous with the begena, the ten-stringed musical instrument bearing remarkable resemblance to the harp. He is quick, however, to caution against using this term to define the begena. They are from the same genre, but not the same family, he explains. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first saw Alemu Aga in 1990 when he played his begena at St. John's Church in Addis Ababa during the fasting season. Those were the worst days for the traditional instrument which, according to many Ethiopian music researchers, dates back to the days of King David in Palestine. Hostile to everything religious, the Dergue government took issue with the begena and the great spiritual heritage of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. It was banned from public life. Radio editors were instructed not to broadcast the instrument, and the course taught by Alemu at Yared Music Institute was abandoned. It was the days of total assault on traditional values. Religion was incriminated. Considering the paranoia of the Dergue, it is a miracle that Alemu survived that time without having to go through jail time, at least, says historian Yared Tadesse.</p>
<p>Alemu's survival owes much to his unobtrusive personality. He quit his job as a music instructor and retreated to private life, playing the begena only in churches and his home. Having endured the days of persecution, Alemu has once again resurfaced to intervene on the side of tradition, regarding the classical debate surrounding the begena: Should this musical instrument be liberated from its reclusive religious role and be incorporated into modern Ethiopian music?</p>
<p>The reaction to the audacious attempt by one of Ethiopia's great musical composers, Mulatu Astatke, to include the begena in his modern musical works tells a story of its own. He was derided by Alemu and fellow begena players and taken to court for alleged flagrant violation of copyrights, despite the difficulty of raising such issues on traditional works. Alemu is unequivocal and forceful in his rejection of the begena's worldly use. Begena is an instrument for tranquil spiritual contemplation and mediation. It is disrespectful to use it for any other purposes,he argues. Observing Alemu play the instrument, one can't help but feel that his argument is genuine. His lips are pursed in meditation and he appears absorbed in fragile trance one dares not interrupt. Alemu can't pin down the exact source of this tranquility, but insists the cause lies solely in the act of playing the begena.</p>
<p>Yared Tadesse thinks personal experiences and religious dogmatism shouldn't inform the debate about the begena. Failure to attune to new reality and the requirements of modern life is the church's eminent failure. The resistance to Begena's role in worldly music is represents that lack of hermeneutical approach,says Yared.</p>
<p>Yet some music researchers think that the limits of the begena have more to do with esthetics than sociology. The strings have such a low pitch that the sound is stifled when played with other instruments. The famous Orchestra Ethiopias experimentation with the instrument during the Haile Sellasie period accordingly failed to inspire, due to the begena's muted sound.</p>
<p>Alemu Aga, who affectionately refers to the begena as the shy instrument, nonetheless resists the esthetic explanation. He shows me a unique begena, made of stings imported from France. The sound is significantly amplified and the strings can be tuned to raise the pitch. D/N Daniel Seifemichael, who teaches at the Trinity Theology College in Addis Ababa, claims that most of the new begena players are using it to emulate the sound of the bass guitar. There is no basis for the begena as superfluous argument. It is heresy of the highest order.</p>
<p>Daniel is more of a functionalist than Alemu. He rejects the expansion of the Begena's role solely on the grounds of its historical purpose. Why do we insist on using Begena for modern non-religious music when its historical function was religious he asks. With the role of traditional religious institutions rapidly declining, this is a question that must be answered either way.</p>
